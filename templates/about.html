    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the
            quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
            would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge
            of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and
            survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot,
            along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

        <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
        <p>
            Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The
            Lord of the Rings.

            Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of
            Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring,
            and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a
            book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his
            heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.

            Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the
            Undying Lands.

        <h3>Gandalf</h3>
        <p>
            Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin]),
            was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined
            Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship
            of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
